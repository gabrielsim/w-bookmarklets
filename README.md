## What are bookmarklets
A bookmarklet is a bookmark stored in a web browser that contains JavaScript commands that add new features to the browser. Bookmarklets are unobtrusive JavaScripts stored as the URL of a bookmark in a web browser or as a hyperlink on a web page. [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet)

## Installing the bookmarklet
Make a new bookmark in your browser (right-click on the bookmarks bar and click Add Page...)

* Set **Name** to any label that you wish.
* Copy the contents of `script.js` from the bookmarklet you wish to use and paste it into the **Location** of your new bookmark.
* Browse to an appropriate Workato page and click on the bookmark to activate its function.
